# Changelog

All notable changes to riverctl will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- `message stream` no longer goes silently deaf when River re-keys the room
  contract while it is running. It used to look up the room's address once at
  startup and never again, so after a re-key it kept listening to a contract
  nobody writes to: no error, no output, just a room that appeared to go quiet
  until the bot was restarted. It now re-checks every few minutes and, when
  River's pointer names a different generation, **exits with status 75** so a
  supervisor restarts it. A restarted riverctl uses the current generation.
  (freenet/river#694)

  **If you run a bot, run it under something that restarts it on any failure,
  with a short delay** (systemd `Restart=on-failure` plus `RestartSec=`), and
  note that a restart with `--initial-messages N` re-emits the last N messages.
  See "Running `message stream` as a long-lived bot" in the README.
- `message stream` without `--subscribe` no longer re-emits the room's recent
  history when it starts. It recorded only the messages it displayed, so with the
  default `--initial-messages 0` the first poll reported every recent message as
  new, and with `-i N` it reported all but N of them. It now records everything
  already in the room and shows only the last N, as `--subscribe` always has.
  This matters more now that streams restart on every re-key.
- A polling `message stream` whose `--poll-interval` is longer than the re-check
  interval (a few minutes) now also polls at each re-check, so a long interval
  cannot delay noticing a re-key.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- `message stream --format json` now includes `author_verifying_key` on every
  event (`message`, `edit`, `delete`, `reaction`), matching `message list`.
  Previously only the `message list` backfill carried the author's full key, so a
  bot driven off the live stream had to fall back to a `message list` call per
  event to recover it, or trust the 8-character `author` short id (a 40-bit
  truncation of a 64-bit non-cryptographic hash, which two members can share) or
  the member-controlled `nickname`. Both stream modes are covered (polling and
  `--subscribe`). Resolution and base58 encoding now come from a single shared
  helper, so the backfill and the live feed cannot drift. The value is `null`
  when the author is not in the room state riverctl holds — departed, pruned, or
  a members delta not yet merged — and never a wrong key. On a `reaction` event
  it names the author of the message reacted to, not the reactor; `reactors`
  remains short ids only. (freenet/river#679)

## [0.2.14] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Member-targeting commands (`member ban`, `member deputize`,
  `member revoke-deputy`, `member deputies`, `member deputized-by`) now accept a
  member's full base58 verifying key in place of the 8-character short ID. A
  full key names exactly one member (the short ID is a 40-bit truncation that
  two members can share), so it resolves unambiguously and satisfies
  `--require-exact-member-id` by construction.
- `message list --format json` now includes an `author_verifying_key` field
  (base58, or `null` when the author is no longer in room state), so a bot can
  identify a message's author by their collision-proof key.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- `member list` now shows each member's full ed25519 verifying key (base58) —
  in human output as an indented `key:` line, and in `--format json` as a
  `verifying_key` field. The 8-character short id is only a 40-bit truncation
  and is cheap to collide on a targeted basis, so use the full verifying key
  (which matches `identity whoami`'s `verifying_key`) as the collision-proof
  identity when trusting a member, e.g. a bot allow-list.

## [0.1.8] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed
- Publish membership delta on invite accept so other members see invitee
- Add INFO logs for GET/SUBSCRIBE/UPDATE during accept
- Reduce GET/SUBSCRIBE timeouts (2s/1s) to fail fast

## [0.1.7] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- Fixed architectural issue with GET operations using `subscribe: true`
  - GET operations now use `subscribe: false` followed by separate SUBSCRIBE operations
  - This fixes compatibility with Freenet's current architecture
  - Both `get_room()` and `accept_invitation()` methods updated
- This fix enables multi-user messaging to work properly

### Technical Details
- GET with subscribe:true requires performing sub-operations from within the main operation and waiting for them to complete, which was never implemented in Freenet
- The fix separates GET and SUBSCRIBE into distinct operations, matching how the River web UI already works

## [0.1.6] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- Fixed critical bug where invited users could not send messages after accepting invitations (#28)
  - Room state is now properly initialized when accepting invitations
  - Invited users are correctly added to the members list
  - Member info with nickname is properly created
- Added validation to ensure room state initialization is correct

### Added
- Comprehensive unit tests for invitation flow
- Integration test script for multi-user scenarios
